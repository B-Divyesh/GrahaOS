**GrahaOS – An AI-Integrated Operating System from Scratch**
*Introducing the GrahaOS Control Protocol (GCP)*

GrahaOS is an AI-integrated operating system built entirely from the ground up. At its core is a custom-designed communication interface known as the **Operating System Control Protocol**, internally referred to as the **GrahaOS Control Protocol (GCP)**. GCP enables seamless and secure interaction between the AI and the OS at a fundamental level.

**Installation Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grahaos.git
   ```
   **install dependencies**
   ```bash
   #for linux fedora (for which this project was built on)
   sudo dnf install gcc-c++ make git gcc make xosrriso qemu nasm bison libelf-devel 
   #please refer to osdev-wiki if you lack any libraries
   ```
   **Build the OS**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make install
   make run
   #this will allow you to run on qemu
   ```


### How GCP Works

The idea is to radically simplify how AI performs operations on the OS. Here's how the system functions:

1. **System Snapshot Generation**
   GrahaOS has a native snapshot pipeline designed at the kernel level, allowing us to capture a complete system state. This includes:

   * Major CPU register values
   * Debug and kernel messages
   * System metadata and active process information
   * Overall execution state

   This snapshot is compiled into a structured `.osm` file. Because the OS is being built from scratch, the snapshot architecture is fully customizable and lightweight.

2. **External AI Interface via API**
   Once the snapshot is created, it is sent to an external AI system over a network interface (network drivers are currently under development). The AI does not run locally this decision simplifies system design and adds a layer of abstraction and security.

3. **Action Planning via GCP**
   The AI reads the `.osm` file and uses a set of predefined tools to determine its response. These tools consist of:

   * A limited set of AI-specific system calls
   * Macro-like abstractions for high-level operations

   These system calls are isolated from the main OS syscall layer to:

   * Improve speed
   * Prevent unauthorized access to core resources
   * Maintain a clean security boundary between AI and OS internals

4. **Instruction Dispatch**
   The AI sends back a JSON payload containing the ordered instructions it wishes to execute. GrahaOS then processes this instruction list using its internal scheduler and executor mechanisms.

This architecture is intentionally minimalistic, focusing on making AI integration both practical and secure without granting the AI unchecked control over the system.

### Vision for GrahaOS

The goal of GrahaOS is to move beyond traditional human-computer interaction paradigms. We envision a future where users can interact with their computers naturally through voice and conversation without needing to understand peripherals like keyboards or mice.

A computer should:

* Listen
* Understand intent
* Take action
* Visualize thought processes

All with minimal or no manual intervention.

### Technical Roadmap

Moving forward, the key milestones include:

* Building a full-scale, modular OS with abstraction layers that optimize snapshot efficiency while retaining semantic fidelity
* Developing a local SLM (Small Language Model) or ML Algorithm to autonomously manage:

  * Memory and page faults
  * File access patterns
  * System behavior learned from user habits


This local model will serve as the AI’s assistant, helping with low-level system tasks in real-time, improving efficiency through continual learning. We will also be adding dedicated syscalls that the local LLM can use to seperate it from the core Kernel.

### Important Notes

> **Dependencies:**
> Two essential components are currently excluded from the public release:
>
> * The toolchain: based on GNU Binutils (with Gold 2.x)
> * The compiler: GCC 15.x.x

> **On Originality and Inspiration:**
> While the concept of an AI-integrated OS is not entirely new:-such as Rutgers University's AIOS SDK framework, GrahaOS maintains a unique approach by integrating AI from the kernel level up, not as an application-layer addition. Even if others are exploring similar ideas, I’m committed to continuing this project out of passion and belief in its potential.

**Final Thoughts**

GrahaOS is a project of passion, vision, and experimentation. Whether or not it’s the first of its kind, it represents a bold rethinking of what operating systems can become when designed for AI, not just alongside it.

**Contributors Welcome.**
